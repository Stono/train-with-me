# train-with-me [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Stono/train-with-me.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Stono/train-with-me)
Ionic mobile application to enable me to easily share and compete with other sporty folk across the globe.

## Runnning
If you're running on your host, rather than from Docker, check the Dockerfile and copy the install dependencies.

At the time I wrote this README, they were `npm install -g --depth=0 --no-summary --quiet ionic@2.0.0-beta.36 cordova@6.3.0`

The build, test and start the app
```
  npm run clean
  npm install
  npm test
  npm start
```
